n this article I will explain how you can perform searches on Recordsets using queries.

Previously in the article Iterate and Search for Values in a Table, Access VBA I’ve explained how you can perform searches on a recordset object using a simple iteration. The method in this article uses Select Queries which are much faster than the method explained in that article.

In order to use the ADODB.Recordset object you may need to add reference to ADODB object library. For more information on this topic please see the link below:

VBA Access Recordset, Object Library
In this article I will be using the sample database below:
Sample Access Databse

The database has a single table with the name:

“MyTable1”
The table has 4 fields with the following names:

“MyField1”
“MyField2”
“MyField3”
“MyField4”

Syntax:
Example 1:
Example 2:
Syntax:
objRecordset.Open ("SELECT [Comma Separated Field List] " & _
"FROM [Table name] " & _
"WHERE [Criterion]")

The above method will open a recordset with the fields specified by the [Comma Separated Field List], from the table [Table Name], which satisfies the criterion [Criterion].

Example 1:
In this example, a Select query will be performed to return all the data from the first field of the access table:

Sub Example1()
Dim objRecordset As ADODB.Recordset

'initated recordset obejct
Set objRecordset = New ADODB.Recordset
objRecordset.ActiveConnection = CurrentProject.Connection
objRecordset.Open ("Select MyField1 From MyTable1")
End Sub

The resulting recordset object will contain the same data as the query below:
Result 1
You can loop through the values in the recordset object using the code below:

Sub Example2()
Dim objRecordset As ADODB.Recordset
Dim varTemp As Variant

'initated recordset obejct
Set objRecordset = New ADODB.Recordset
objRecordset.ActiveConnection = CurrentProject.Connection
objRecordset.Open ("Select MyField1 From MyTable1")
'loop through the values in the recordset object
While objRecordset.EOF = False
'get the current value
varTemp = objRecordset.Fields.Item(0).value
'move to the next record
objRecordset.MoveNext
Wend
End Sub

–
Example 2:
In this example a select query will be performed that will return records which contain the number 110 in their second field (“MyField2”):

Sub Example3()
Dim objRecordset As ADODB.Recordset

'initated recordset obejct
Set objRecordset = New ADODB.Recordset
objRecordset.ActiveConnection = CurrentProject.Connection
objRecordset.Open ("Select MyField1, MyField2, " & _
"MyField3, MyField4 " & _
"From MyTable1 " & _
"Where MyField2 = 110")
End Sub

The resulting Recordset will have the same data as the query below:
Result 2
You can the access the values in the different fields using the code below:

Sub Example4()
Dim objRecordset As ADODB.Recordset
Dim varField1 As Variant
Dim varField2 As Variant
Dim varField3 As Variant
Dim varField4 As Variant

'initated recordset obejct
Set objRecordset = New ADODB.Recordset
objRecordset.ActiveConnection = CurrentProject.Connection
objRecordset.Open ("Select MyField1, MyField2, " & _
"MyField3, MyField4 " & _
"From MyTable1 " & _
"Where MyField2 = 110")
'get record values
varField1 = objRecordset.Fields(0).value
varField2 = objRecordset.Fields(1).value
varField3 = objRecordset.Fields(2).value
varField4 = objRecordset.Fields(3).value
End Sub
